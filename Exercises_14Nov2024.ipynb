    "### Growth factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The cosmological growth factor describes the rate of growth of dark matter perturbations in the Universe and is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$D(a) = \\large \\frac{5 \\Omega_m}{2} \\frac{H(a)}{H_0} \\int_0^a \\frac{da'}{ (a' H(a')/H_0)^3}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the scale factor, $\\Omega_m$ is the matter density parameter and $H(a)$ is the Hubble rate. In a flat Universe, after radiation domination, we can write H(a) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ H(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{(\\Omega_m a^{-3} + \\Omega_{\\Lambda})}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ is the vacuum energy density (in a flat Universe, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 1 - \\Omega_m$).\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write a code to calculate the growth factor as a function of a, for given values of the cosmological parameters, using two numerical integration methods of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Plot the growth factor in the scale factor range $a \\in [0.1,2]$ for the following values of $\\Omega_m$: $0.1$, $0.3$, $0.6$, $1$ (assume a present day expansion rate $H_0 = 67.4 \\, {\\rm km} \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$). Make a panel with two plots, one for each integration method you chose. Set logscale on x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Optional. For $a = 0.5$, compute the growth factor using the Simpson's rule with varying N and check the convergence rate of the result. Start by sampling the integration interval with ten points and then increase the sample size by a factor of $2$ at each step. How many steps do you need to achieve a final desired accuracy of $10^{-12}$ ?\n",
